Making a game engine in a week is a steep challenge, so we are going to take as many shortcuts as we can. For example, we are going to:
- Stick to 2D graphics.
- Use a library to handle the windowing, rendering, audio and input.
- Rely on external tools for editing assets.
- Use a scripting language for all game logic.

We will progress feature by feature, which rarely (if ever), happens on a real project.  

In real life, you will have to work on multiple features at the same time, and you will have to refactor your code to make it more maintainable.

But this is a tutorial, so we will take the easy route. You can start with the skeleton given by the tutorial and add your own features to it as you go along.
